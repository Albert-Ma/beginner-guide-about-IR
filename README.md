# IR beginner's guide based on personal experience

People, especially those IR beginners, always ask me something basic but necessary in IR application or research.
So I try to write what I know to avoid repeated effort and make more IR beginners know and get started quickly into the IR field.
As you know, this is based on personal knowledge and experience, and there is no guarantee that everything is correct(correct me please if you think I'm wrong).
But I hope you can benefit from this guide and give some feedback.
